# Serverless Efficiency

This section aims to explain how organizations and individuals can benefit from the efficiency that serverless architectures offer.

### No Servers to Manage

Serverless architectures do not require **US (Developers, Organizations)** to manage underlying infrastructure. AWS on the other hand manages the server management activities for us so that we can focus on writing our application's features and capabilities.

Since serverless-based systems do not require organizations to manage servers. Organizations achieve cost-efficiency in spending money involved in the following activities:

- Managing Cluster Scalability
- Implementing Disaster Recovery and Strategy
- Patching Security Vulnerabilities
- Installing Operating System Updates
- Hiring Server Management Staff

### Reduced Security Risk & Cost

One cool side-effect of letting AWS manage the underlying infrastructure is the reduction in terms of **security risk** and cost associated with it. If we think about it, AWS hires top of the line security and infrastructure engineers. Utilizing serverless architectures is almost similar to asking these world class professionals to manage our infrastructure which ultimately results to cost and risk reduction in the security departments.

### Reduction in Compute Bills

Since AWS Lambda's billing mode require us to pay for execution time, we can save a significant amount of money by eliminating cost generated by:

- Idle time (Payment made for time where servers' aren't processing invocations.)
- Designing Highly Available Systems (Payment for server redundancy and disaster recovery designing)

Lambda-based APIs are resilient to disasters as it can automatically switch executions between availability zones in a single AWS region.

### Reduction in Delivery Time

Since Lambda-based APIs allow us to focus on building our application. We can spend the same budget that we use to spend on paying for activities related to provisioning servers, testing scalability and disaster recovery strategies.

## Anonymous Case Study

![Case Study](https://github.com/allanchua101/serverless-ninja/blob/master/docs/001-serverless-efficiency/actual-lambda-cost.png)

I have been working with a team in the past 1 and a half year at the time of this article's writing. We have a total of **71 Cloud Formation stacks** of pure serverless magic and spread of **460+ Lambda functions**. In the month of July 2020, we made a total of **91K API calls** that required **91 hours of actual runtime** in Lambda and ultimately cost us 0 SGD for our development environments.

We've also sent 6.6 million queue messages using SQS and payed a whopping 2 SGD for the mentioned month. In contrast, we estimated that using traditional architecture would require us to pay at least 19K SGD with the following assumptions:

![Traditional Architecture](https://github.com/allanchua101/serverless-ninja/blob/master/docs/001-serverless-efficiency/traditional-cost.png)

- 1 EC2 t2.xlarge cost 0.185 an hour
- We would typically require 2 instances of this for HA architecture which would cost .370 SGD an hour
- If we compute rental time for the whole month of an EC2-based workload it would result to the following formula:

```txt
# Price of a single API Cluster a month
.370 X 730 hours a month = $ 270.10 a month.

# Multiply it to 71 API stacks in development environment
270.10 X 71 = 19,710 SGD / Month
```

I did not factored-in the manpower required in managing the EC2 fleet and continuously monitoring them which typically requires a significant amount of money in Singapore. I hope that this case study showed how serverless architectures can help organizations in saving production software cost.
