This section aims to explain how organizations and individuals can benefit from the efficiency that serverless architectures offer.

### No Servers to Manage

Serverless architectures do not require **US (Developers, Organizations)** to manage underlying infrastructure. AWS on the other hand manages the server management activities for us so that we can focus on writing our application's features and capabilities.

Since serverless-based systems do not require organizations to manage servers. Organizations achieve cost-efficiency in spending money involved in the following activities:

- Managing Cluster Scalability
- Implementing Disaster Recovery and Strategy
- Patching Security Vulnerabilities
- Installing Operating System Updates
- Hiring Server Management Staff

### Reduced Security Risk & Cost

One cool side-effect of letting AWS manage the underlying infrastructure is the reduction in terms of **security risk** and cost associated with it. If we think about it, AWS hires top of the line security and infrastructure engineers. Utilizing serverless architectures is almost similar to asking these world class professionals to manage our infrastructure which ultimately results to cost and risk reduction in the security departments.
